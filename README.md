Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable can be done by
dividing code into modules based on their functionality. When developing the 
Grazioso Salvare project, multiple MongoDB queries would have to be performed,
so it only made sense to create reusable code. By creating a MongoDB CRUD python
module, various CRUD operations could be accessed without having to rewrite the
same starter code. Because the code is modular, it could be used again to design
a different dashboard, like one that allows the user to interact with UI controls
to connect to and edit an arbitrary database running on a server. Creating the 
dashboard for Grazioso Salvare required approaching the problem from a requirements
point of view to figure out what Dash components and layout could provide the
company with the functionality they desired. There was quite a bit of leeway in
terms of requirements, so it was necessary to use trial and error to find out
which components and data visualizations would function as intended. A computer
scientist approaches problems from an analytical point of view to not only solve
the problem at hand but to do it in an efficient and organized way. A computer
scientist should be able to make the connection between business requirements and
software implementation by understanding the business problem thoroughly. A company
like Grazioso Salvare can greatly benefit from a computer scientist that is able
to translate customer experiences and business requirements into funcitonal code
that can provide value to the company for months or years.
